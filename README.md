RGBD-Hough-Forest
=================

This is a "MSR-SSLA" (Microsoft Research Shared Source license agreement ) licensed project for object detection in RGB-Depth images using Hough-Forest.

This code was developed during my master thesis in University of Bonn (Artificial Intelligent System Group headed by Prof. Dr. Sven Behnke)
