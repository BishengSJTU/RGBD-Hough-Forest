{"name":"RGB-D Hough Forest","tagline":"This is a MSR-SSLA licensed project for object detection in RGB-D images using Hough-Forest.","body":"# Welcome to RGB-D Hough Forest project page.\r\n\r\nThis code is developed during my master thesis in [AIS](http://www.ais.uni-bonn.de/), [University of Bonn](http://www3.uni-bonn.de/) under the guidance of [Prof. Dr. Sven Behnke](http://www.ais.uni-bonn.de/behnke/index.html)\r\n\r\nAll directories contain CMakelists.txt, follow the instruction below to make the project\r\n## General steps to make your project using CMake.\r\n* In your project directory Make build directory using shell command mkdir build\r\n* go to the build directory cd build\r\n* ccmake .. will let you configure your make file.( The respective keyboard command options are shown at the bottom. )\r\n* make && make install\r\n* You can find your executable in the project folder. \r\n\r\nFor more information on how to run each code kindly read README.md file.\r\n\r\n## What you will find here?\r\n* Complete code for training the class-specific forest and 6-DoF object detection. (C++)\r\n* Already trained class-specific forests for 6 object categories (bowl, cap, cereal-box, coffee-mug, flashlight, soda-can).\r\n* Evaluation code. (C++)\r\n* Artificially generated training images from [RGB-D Obejct Dataset].(http://www.cs.washington.edu/rgbd-dataset/dataset/).\r\n* Code for generating training images. (C++)\r\n* Pose( only verticaly upward direction ) annotations for [RGB-D Scene Dataset].(http://www.cs.washington.edu/rgbd-dataset/dataset/)\r\n* Pose annotation code. (C++)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n* [Ishrat Badami](http://www.mmp.rwth-aachen.de/)(@ibadami)\r\n\r\n### Support/Contact\r\nFind answers to all your questions by contacting me on this E-mail id : badami@vision.rwth-aachen.de","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
