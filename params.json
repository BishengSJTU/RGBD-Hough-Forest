{"name":"RGB-D Hough Forest","tagline":"This is a GNU licensed project for object detection in RGB-D images using Hough-Forest.","body":"# Welcome to RGB-D Hough Forest project page.\r\n\r\nThe latest version of the code is updated in the repository. You can build all the codes using CMake. the corresponding CMakelists.txt files are included in each of the directories. \r\n\r\n## General steps to make your project using CMake.\r\n* In your project directory Make build directory using shell command mkdir build\r\n* go to the build directory cd build\r\n* ccmake .. will let you configure your make file.( The respective keyboard command options are shown at the bottom. )\r\n* make && make install\r\n* You can find your executable in the project folder. \r\n\r\nFor more information on how to run each code kindly read README.md file.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What you will find here?\r\n* Complete code for training the class-specific forest and 6-DoF object detection. (C++)\r\n* Already trained class-specific forests for 6 object categories (bowl, cap, cereal-box, coffee-mug, flashlight, soda-can).\r\n* Evaluation code. (C++)\r\n* Artificially generated training images from [RGB-D Obejct Dataset].(http://www.cs.washington.edu/rgbd-dataset/dataset/).\r\n* Code for generating training images. (C++)\r\n* Pose( only verticaly upward direction ) annotations for [RGB-D Scene Dataset].(http://www.cs.washington.edu/rgbd-dataset/dataset/)\r\n* Pose annotation code. (C++)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n* Ishrat Badami(@ibadami)\r\n* Joerg Stuckler\r\n* Sven Behnke\r\n\r\n### Support/Contact\r\nFind answers to all your problems by contacting me on this E-mail id : badami@vision.rwth-aachen.de\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
