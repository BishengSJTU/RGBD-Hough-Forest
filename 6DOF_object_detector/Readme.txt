The provided software has three directories:
 
detector: contains the c++ source code of the multi-class detector. 

matlab: the matlab functions for calculating the hierarchies and sharing matrices

VOC: pre-trained forests and the config files for the VOC'06 and VOC'07 
datasets are included in this directory.  


// detector directory: //

Source code for the multi-class detector. 

# compile # (needs OpenCV 2.0)
make all

# clean #
make clean

# run #
./run.sh
run this script to get information about the program inputs

A config.txt example is given in the subdirectory 'example'

# multiclass training file #
You can use the function matlab/readTrainingFiles.m to read the training data into matlab.

3// number of classes (including background)
1 class_1.txt// the first positive class 
1 class_2.txt// the second positive class
0 class_bg.txt// the background class

# each training file #
50 1 // number of images + dummy value (1)
/PATH/image.png 0 0 74 36 37 18 // filename + boundingbox (top left - bottom right) + center of bounding box

# multiclass test data #
The test data is organized in a very similar way to the training data. You can use the matlab/readTestFiles.m to read them. 

# hierarchy #
The hierarchy is stored as a text files with the following format:
19 // number of nodes - 1 
19 2 1 0.816167 -1 10 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9// node_id leftChild rightChild linkage parent(-1 root) nSubClasses subclasses(10 in this case)
...

# outputs: #
When running the detector it produces a directory for each candidate. The name of the directory is set to:
detect_o[O]_n[N]-[S]-[I]_cand_all
O: tree offset
N: number of trees
S: test set
I: image number in that set

In each directory, two files are written: boundingboxes.txt and candidates.txt

candidates.txt:
5000 // number of detected candidates
0.0292673 313.1 141.6 1.8 19 0 // detection confidence x_position y_position scale class_id dummy
...

boundingboxes.txt
5000 // number of bounding boxes
520 221 600 309 // x_min y_min x_max y_max
...

// matlab directory // 

readTxtForest.m // reading the forest into matlab
readTrainingFiles.m // reading the multi-class training files.
readTestFiles.m // reading the multiclass test files.
getSharingMatrixAppearance.m // calculating the appearance sharing matrix from the forest.
getSharingMatrixAppearanceLocation.m // calculating the appearance and location sharing matrix from the forest.
clusterSharingMatrix.m // calculating the hierarchy by clustering the sharing matrix
